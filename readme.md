#Carbun
The idea is to educate the people on the cause of climate change by letting them know about the amount of carbon they emit in their daily life. We made a carbon calculator which sugggests the approx amount of carbon exposed to our nature from Railways, Cars, Metro's and Airplanes. Once identifying carbon in KG we suggest the amount of trees to be planted. 
We made a credit base system to reinforce our clients to plant more trees and earning more credits. The reward is associated after gaining x amount of credits.
